    "question": "What is the optimal next interval when you partially recall information in spaced repetition?",
    "answer": "30-50% (or 40-60%) of the interval you would use for perfect recall.<br><br>Key principle: <b>Shorter than success, longer than failure</b><br><br>Partial recall means storage strength is still there but retrieval strength has weakened, so don't penalize as harshly as complete forgetting.",

    "question": "Why is partial recall (struggling to retrieve) actually beneficial for long-term learning?",
    "answer": "Effortful retrieval produces <b>better long-term retention</b> than easy retrieval. This is called \"<b>desirable difficulty</b>\".<br><br>Struggling to retrieve (and eventually succeeding) strengthens the memory trace more than effortless recall. Partial recall indicates you're at an optimal difficulty level for learning.",

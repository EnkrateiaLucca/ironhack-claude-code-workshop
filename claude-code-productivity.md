f you thought coding agents were just for programmers, think again. Claude Code, Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, is out to be one of the most powerful productivity assistants you can have — even if you never write a line of code.

In this article, we’ll explore how to leverage Claude Code for everyday knowledge work: taking notes, creating flashcards, conducting research, managing your calendar, and even generating presentations. Let’s dive in.

What is Claude Code?
Claude Code is essentially a coding assistant that works in your computer terminal. It can control your computer, perform commands, and handle complex tasks through a natural language chat interface. You install it, open it in any folder, and start chatting with an AI that can actually do things on your machine.

To get started, you simply type claude in your terminal (after installation), and you can immediately start giving it instructions like in the image below:

Claude Code will fetch the content, process it, and create the file — all while asking for your permission before taking actions (unless you’re feeling brave and use the YOLO mode, which we’ll discuss later).

The Power of CLAUDE.md Files One of Claude Code’s most useful features is the CLAUDE.md configuration file. Think of it as Claude’s memory — a place where you can store instructions that Claude should always remember, no matter where you are on your computer.

Global Configuration
You can create a CLAUDE.md file in the global .claude folder (located at the root of your machine). This file contains instructions that apply every time you run Claude Code, regardless of which folder you’re working in.

For example, you might include:

Location of your Obsidian vault
Your Anki database path
Preferred automation scripts folder
Default transcription commands
Custom snippets locations
Here’s a real example:

My Obsidian vault is located at: ~/obsidian-vault/path
My Anki deck is stored here: ~/anki-database/path
My reusable automations are always stored in ~/automations/path
You can also create project-specific CLAUDE.md files in any folder you’re working in. These local configurations override or extend the global settings.

Note-Taking with Claude Code & Obsidian
One of the most powerful use cases is integrating Claude Code with your note-taking system. If you use Obsidian (or any markdown-based note system), Claude Code becomes a cognitive layer that can create, edit, organize, and connect your notes.

Creating Notes You can ask Claude to research a topic and save it directly to your vault:

Could you integrate this note into my Obsidian vault?

Because Claude knows where your vault is (from the CLAUDE.md file), it automatically saves the note in the right place.

Bulk Operations on Notes
This is where things get interesting. You can ask Claude to perform semantic tasks across multiple notes:

Could you search for small notes (less than three lines) in my vault
that may be useless or redundant. Also look for notes named “untitled.md”

Claude will search through your notes, analyze their content, and provide recommendations — something that would take hours to do manually. The AI doesn’t just search for file sizes; it actually reads and understands the meaning of your notes to determine what’s relevant.

Creating Summary Notes with Backlinks
You can also create meta-notes that reference your existing knowledge:

Could you write a single note with a summary plus referencing
(using Obsidian’s way of referencing files) for all my notes
related to agents, coding agents, things like Claude Code, etc.?
Make the note well-structured, concise, in a bullet-point style.

Claude will create a summary note that not only synthesizes the information but also links back to all the source notes using Obsidian’s [[note-name]] syntax. This creates a knowledge graph layer on top of your existing notes.

Creating Anki Flashcards
If you’re into spaced repetition and memorization, the Anki integration is absolutely brilliant. Anki is a free, open-source flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you memorize information effectively.

From Notes to Flashcards
After creating or reviewing notes, you can instantly convert them into Anki flashcards:

I want to refresh my memory on the topic of best practice workflows
with coding agents. Based on what you read, could you create Anki
flashcards and save them to my Anki DB for me to review.
Create 5 to start.

Claude will:

Analyze the content
Generate well-structured flashcards (question/answer format)
Save them as an importable file
Reference the source notes
The flashcards are automatically formatted and ready to import into your Anki database.

From Web Content to Flashcards
You can even create flashcards directly from web articles. Using custom commands (which we’ll cover later), you can do:

/anki-cards [paste article URL]

Claude fetches the article, extracts key information, and generates 10+ flashcards with proper sourcing. This is invaluable when you’re learning from online resources and want to retain the information.

Important note: Creating flashcards automatically is convenient, but for deep learning, you should still read the source material, engage with it critically, and be deliberate about what you choose to memorize. Claude Code accelerates the process but doesn’t replace the thinking.

Research Reports with Deep-Linked Citations
One of the most innovative workflows involves creating research reports with text fragment deep links — clickable citations that take you directly to the specific passage in the source article that supports a claim.

Text Fragment Links
Modern browsers support text fragment links, which allow you to link not just to a page, but to a specific highlighted portion of text. Browser extensions like “Copy Link to Selected Text” or “Copy Link to Highlight” enable this functionality.

For example, instead of linking to:

https://example.com/article
You link to:

https://example.com/article#:~:text=specific%20quoted%20passage
When someone clicks that link, the browser scrolls to and highlights that exact passage.

Creating Research Reports
You can ask Claude to create research reports that use these deep links:

Create a research report for these sources: [URLs].
For PDFs, use quotes instead to reference and validate claims.
Make it very actionable with insights and bullet points.

Claude will:

Fetch the sources (using wget for PDFs if needed)
Extract key insights
Create a well-structured report with sections
Include text fragment links for web sources
Include direct quotes for PDFs with page references
This creates a research report where every claim is backed by a clickable citation that takes you directly to the source passage. This is incredibly powerful for fact-checking, verifying information, and maintaining intellectual honesty in your knowledge work.

The workflow helps combat AI hallucinations — you’re not just trusting Claude’s summary; you can instantly verify each claim against the original source.

Calendar Management with MCP
Claude Code supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, which allow it to integrate with external tools like Google Calendar.

Setting Up Google Calendar
After setting up the Google Calendar MCP (which involves getting API credentials from Google Console), you can:

List events: See what’s on your calendar
Create events: Add new appointments
Update/delete events: Modify your schedule
Search events: Find specific meetings
Bulk Scheduling
The real power comes with bulk scheduling around existing commitments:

I need to buy a snowboard for a trip I have coming up,
and I need to do it over the next week. Could you schedule
it for me around my schedule? Find a spot and create the event.

Claude will:

Check your calendar for the next week
Find available time slots
Suggest an optimal time
Create the event
This becomes especially useful when you have multiple tasks to schedule and want to optimize them around your existing commitments.

PDF Handouts and Presentations
For educators, course creators, and content producers, Claude Code can generate professional materials following brand guidelines.

PDF Handouts with Brand Guidelines
You can create a reference document containing your brand’s visual identity (colors, fonts, layout preferences) and use it to generate consistent materials:

Create a simple PDF handout skill that references this brand
guidelines document to create cheat sheets and PDF handouts
for social media posts.

Claude will create a reusable workflow that generates PDF handouts matching your brand’s aesthetic. This ensures visual consistency across all your materials without manually designing each one.

Presentation Slides with Remark.js
Remark.js is an open-source framework that creates HTML-based presentations from markdown files. It’s lightweight, customizable, and perfect for technical presentations.

You can create a Claude Skill for generating presentations:

Use Claude Code specialized skill to create Remark HTML-based slides
that can be exported into PDFs. Create a set of slides for this
presentation I did on using Claude Code for non-coding tasks.

Claude will:

Research the topic (reading your notes, relevant articles, etc.)
Structure the presentation
Generate markdown-formatted slides
Create an HTML file using the Remark.js template
Include inline citations for any referenced sources
Become a member The resulting presentation is browser-based, easy to share, and can be exported to PDF. This workflow is particularly useful for educators who teach multiple courses and need to generate slide decks regularly.

Claude Skills: Crystallizing Your Workflows
Claude Skills are one of the most powerful features for productivity work. According to Anthropic’s deep dive, skills are “organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically.”

Unlike traditional tools that execute code and return results, skills work through prompt expansion. When you invoke a skill:

Claude loads a markdown file (SKILL.md)
Expands it into detailed instructions
Injects those instructions into the conversation context
Modifies how Claude processes subsequent requests
As the first-principles deep dive by Lee Hanchung explains, “Skills prepare Claude to solve a problem rather than solving it directly.”

Anatomy of a Skill
A typical skill folder contains:

my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (main instructions)
├── scripts/ (executable scripts)
├── references/ (documentation, examples)
└── assets/ (supporting files)
The SKILL.md file teaches Claude:

What the skill does
When to use it
How to execute it
What format to use for output
Which tools to employ
Example: Anki Card Creator Skill
Here’s what an Anki flashcard skill might include:

# Anki Card Creator Skill
 
## Purpose
Create Anki flashcards from content and save them to the Anki database.
 
## When to Use
- When the user asks to create flashcards
- When reviewing notes that should be memorized
- When processing educational content
 
## Output Format
CSV format with fields: Front, Back, Source
 
## Execution
Run the bundled Python script: `scripts/createankicards.py`
 
## Database Location
/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Anki2/User 1/collection.anki2
Once you create this skill, you can invoke it anytime, and Claude will follow the exact workflow you defined.

Creating Skills with Claude
The meta-level magic: you can ask Claude Code to create skills for itself:

Create a PDF handout skill that references my brand guidelines
document to create cheat sheets for social media posts.

Claude will generate the skill folder, write the SKILL.md file, create any necessary scripts, and install it in your .claude/skills/ directory. You just created a reusable workflow without writing any code yourself.

Custom Commands
In addition to skills, you can create custom commands — simpler, prompt-based shortcuts that you invoke with /command-name.

For example, a /anki-cards command might look like:

Create Anki flashcards from this content.

Output format: CSV with Front, Back, Source fields.

Rules:
- Create 10–15 cards
- Use clear, concise questions
- Include source URLs or file paths
- Save to: ~/Desktop/anki_import.csv

Save this as anki-cards.md in .claude/commands/, and you can now type /anki-cards [URL or content] to instantly generate flashcards from any source.

Skills vs. Commands:
Commands are simple prompt templates for quick tasks
Skills are complex, multi-file workflows with bundled scripts and resources
Use commands for quick, repeatable prompts
Use skills for sophisticated, deterministic workflows
The Single Note System
A powerful productivity pattern is the single note system, inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s append-and-review workflow. The concept:

Maintain one primary note file (note.md)
Capture everything there: thoughts, insights, links, quick notes
Review it daily
Extract important items into permanent notes, flashcards, or projects
Claude Code enhances this system by acting as a cognitive layer that can:

Create flashcards from your main note
Generate summaries of specific topics
Find connections between ideas
Archive important information into permanent notes
Suggest what to review or follow up on
The workflow becomes:

Capture everything in your main note
Daily review with Claude’s assistance
Let Claude extract, organize, and connect information
Focus your energy on thinking, not organizing
Running in YOLO Mode (Proceed with Caution)
Claude Code normally asks for permission before executing commands. However, you can run it with — dangerously-disable-sandbox (often aliased as YOLO mode) to skip permissions.

Why you might do this:

Faster workflows when you trust the tasks
Automating repetitive operations
Working with known, safe operations
Why you should be careful:

Claude could execute destructive commands
No guardrails for file operations
Could accidentally delete or modify important files
Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, recommends configuring specific tools that can run without approval rather than disabling all safety checks. Use YOLO mode thoughtfully and never on critical production systems.

Best Practices
Based on extensive use, here are some recommendations:

1. Start Simple
Don’t jump straight into complex skills. Begin with basic commands and understand how Claude processes your requests.

2. Build Your CLAUDE.md Gradually
Add information to your global CLAUDE.md as you discover what you frequently tell Claude. Think of it as training Claude about your personal ecosystem.

3. Verify AI-Generated Content
Always fact-check research reports, especially when making important decisions. Use those deep-linked citations to verify claims.

4. Use Multiple Claude Instances
If you’re doing different tasks, open separate Claude Code sessions. This prevents context pollution and keeps each task focused.

5. Create Skills for Repeated Workflows
If you do something more than three times, consider creating a skill or command for it.

6. Leverage Existing Skills
Check out community-created skills on GitHub repositories like awesome-claude-skills before creating your own.

7. Think About Context Management
Claude Code uses tokens for context. Use /context to check usage. Clear conversations or start fresh instances when needed.

The Philosophy: AI as a Cognitive Layer
What makes Claude Code special for knowledge work isn’t just what it does, but how it fits into your thinking process.

Traditional tools either:

Require you to adapt to them (rigid structure)
Or do things for you (removing you from the process)
Claude Code is different. It acts as a cognitive layer between you and your knowledge:

You do the thinking: reading, reflecting, deciding what’s important
Claude handles the operations: creating files, organizing, connecting, formatting
You verify and iterate: checking outputs, refining workflows
It’s not about automation replacing thought — it’s about removing friction from knowledge work so you can focus on the high-value cognitive tasks: understanding, synthesizing, and creating.

As Anthropic’s research on building effective agents notes, the key is finding the right balance between workflows (predetermined paths) and agents (dynamic problem-solving). For knowledge work, this often means:

Use workflows (skills/commands) for recurring tasks
Use agent mode (free conversation) for exploration and novel problems
Combine both for powerful, flexible systems
Claude Code is not Just For Coding
Claude Code is marketed as a coding agent, but it’s really a general-purpose AI assistant that happens to be exceptionally good at coding. For knowledge workers — researchers, students, educators, writers, anyone who learns for a living — it’s potentially the most powerful productivity tool available today.

The workflows covered here barely scratch the surface:

Note-taking systems become dynamic knowledge graphs
Flashcard creation transforms from tedious to instant
Research becomes verifiable with deep-linked citations
Calendar management adapts to your real schedule
Content creation maintains brand consistency
Workflows crystallize into reusable skills
The future of knowledge work isn’t about AI replacing human thought — it’s about AI removing the tedious parts so humans can think more deeply, learn more effectively, and create more meaningfully.

If you want to become an “AI-native” knowledge worker, as Simon Willison might describe it, Claude Code is an excellent place to start. The skills you develop — prompt engineering, workflow design, knowledge management — will serve you well as these tools continue to evolve.

Give it a try. Start simple. Build your CLAUDE.md file. Create your first skill. And discover what happens when you add an AI cognitive layer to your knowledge work.

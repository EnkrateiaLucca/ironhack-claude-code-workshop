--- DEMO: Show /cost before and after loading a big file ---

Step 1: Run /cost to see current token usage
Step 2: Ask Claude to read a large file (e.g. a research paper PDF)
Step 3: Run /cost again to see the jump in token count
Step 4: Run /compact to summarize and free up context
Step 5: Run /cost one more time to show the reduction

This demonstrates the "desk analogy" — context has a real cost,
and managing it is key to getting great results.

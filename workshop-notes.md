- Claude ? what is Claude COde?
	- claude is just like ChatGPT a model behind a chat interface to use AI to do stuff
- Claude code?
	- its essentially an AI inside your terminal that can control your computer run commands and perform tasks
- Claude code is an agent working inside your computer that can perform commands, act on your behalf through your explicit approaval making it easier to do a variety of tasks, it has access to tools like:
	- web search and many many more
- CLAUDE.md -> memory of claude code (all the information we want this agent or personal assistant to have about us and about how to work effectively)
	- will contain a bunch of information about the current folder of your project
	- you can create the file manually or type /init and have claude code create that for you
- SKILLs are folder with instructions sets bundled with scripts (code that does stuff) that package a group of tasks into a reusable format 
	- once you get an output you like ask claude code to create a skill for it! (also works with Claude desktop)
- Context management tips for right now:
	- LLM shave limited context window
	- occupying too much context leads to poor performance
	- learn to instruct LLMs and Agents with context awareness which means the effect in the context window of the task you are requesting
- lets try to be under around 50/60% of ctx window 
- skill to create anki cards for learning and memorization
- you can bundle and combine skills together to make super powerful workflows
- Skills are the starting point of transfering our domain specific knowledge into an AI ready format
- unlock automated reproducible workflows beyond copy pasting with AI Agents + Skills
